The [libp2p channel on Freenode](irc://irc.freenode.org/%23libp2p) is a great place for live chat:

- Use [#libp2p on irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/%23libp2p) to chat with the libp2p community.

For longer-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at https://discuss.ipfs.io instead of IRC! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on IRC.  Since the discussion board is shared with IPFS and related projects, be sure to tag your threads with the [libp2p tag](https://discuss.ipfs.io/tags/libp2p) to increase its visibility and help people find it.
